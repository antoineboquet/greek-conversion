# Preset character repertoire audit

This audit compares the semantic letters built into the engine with the
character repertoire supported by each preset's cited references. It is about
scope, not only recognition: a character may be named by a reference without
that reference assigning a conversion for it.

The engine contains the ordinary twenty-four-letter Greek alphabet plus six
additional semantic letters:

- `digamma` (`ϝ`);
- `yot` (`ϳ`);
- `stigma` (`ϛ`);
- `koppa` (`ϟ`);
- `archaic-koppa` (`ϙ`);
- `sampi` (`ϡ`).

Lunate sigma is represented as a glyph variant of semantic `sigma`, so it is
discussed separately below.

## Results

Every preset covers the ordinary twenty-four-letter alphabet. The following
matrix records only the six additional entries.

| Preset | Digamma | Yot | Stigma | Koppa | Archaic koppa | Sampi |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ala-lc-ancient` | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| `ala-lc-modern` | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| `bnf-core` | Exact | Exact | Exact | Exact | Different | Exact |
| `iso-843-type-1` | Exact | Exact | Undefined | Undefined | Unresolved | Undefined |
| `perseus` | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside |
| `sbl-academic` | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside |
| `sbl-general` | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside | Outside |
| `tlg-core` | Exact | Different | Exact | Exact | Exact | Exact |

The status terms mean:

- **Exact**: the reference includes the character and the preset's current
  direct mapping agrees;
- **Different**: the reference includes the character, but the engine's mapping
  does not agree;
- **Undefined**: the reference includes the character in its source repertoire
  but does not assign a conversion;
- **Outside**: an enumerated profile or mapping omits the character;
- **Unresolved**: the reference does not distinguish the engine's semantic
  entry clearly enough;
- **?**: the available evidence is insufficient for an exact boundary.

These statuses do not measure complete preset conformance. Contextual rules,
diacritics, punctuation, numeral treatment, and other limitations remain
described in [Preset reference and coverage](presets.md).

## Findings by authority

### ALA-LC

The cited Library of Congress PDFs define the ordinary ancient/medieval and
modern romanization tables, but this audit has not established a reliable,
machine-verifiable inventory for the six additional engine letters. Their
status therefore remains unknown. Absence of evidence is not treated as an
exclusion, and neither ALA-LC preset should yet activate an automatic
allow-list.

### BnF

The BnF explicitly documents digamma, yod, Byzantine sigma, stigma, two koppa
forms, and sampi. Its table assigns `q` to both koppa code points. The engine
agrees for `koppa` (`ϟ`) but currently renders `archaic-koppa` (`ϙ`) as `k`
with a dot below. The BnF repertoire is therefore known, but applying it
automatically would still expose a non-conformant conversion for one entry.

### ISO 843 Type 1

ISO 843 identifies stigma, digamma, koppa, sampi, Byzantine/lunate sigma, and
yot as part of the Greek source repertoire. Its archaic-character conversion
table assigns Latin output only to digamma, yot, and Byzantine sigma. Stigma,
koppa, and sampi are consequently in scope without ISO-defined Type 1 output.

The standard predates Unicode's separate modern and archaic koppa pair used by
the engine. The audit therefore does not equate its single named koppa with
`archaic-koppa` automatically.

### Perseus

Morpheus describes Perseus Beta Code as a letters-and-diacritics subset of TLG.
The cited executable Perseids mapping makes that subset concrete: it contains
the ordinary alphabet and lunate sigma, but none of the engine's six additional
letter entries. A Perseus-specific converter may therefore use the ordinary
twenty-four letters as its exact semantic allow-list.

### SBL

The SBL handbook provides one general-purpose Greek transliteration table and
explicitly leaves distinctions such as digamma to Greek type when they matter.
The library's `sbl-academic` preset is an adapted scientific profile, not a
second official SBL table. Both presets should therefore treat the six
additional entries as outside their cited SBL scope, while retaining their
existing `adapted` coverage label.

### TLG

The TLG quick reference assigns `V`, `#2`, `#1`, `#3`, and `#5` to digamma,
stigma, koppa, archaic koppa, and sampi respectively; these agree with the
engine apart from configurable ASCII case. TLG assigns `#401` to yot, while the
engine currently emits `J`. The TLG core repertoire contains all six entries,
but yot must be corrected before it can be described as conformant.

## Lunate sigma

Lunate sigma is not an independent `Letter`; the parser records it as
`glyphVariant: "lunate-sigma"` on semantic sigma.

- ISO 843 includes Byzantine/lunate sigma and transliterates it as `s`.
- BnF deliberately distinguishes it as `c`; `bnf-core` selects that behavior.
- The Perseids mapping and TLG quick reference both encode it as `S3` (subject
  to the selected ASCII letter case).
- The ALA-LC and SBL boundaries remain governed by their ordinary sigma rules
  until a source establishes a distinct requirement.

## Consequence for automatic enforcement

No bundled preset currently changes `Converter.repertoire`; metadata therefore
continues to report `outOfScopeBehavior: "engine-default"`.

Automatic preset enforcement should proceed only after two independent
changes:

1. correct the BnF archaic-koppa and TLG yot mappings without changing the
   engine-wide defaults required by other profiles;
2. add a preset-aware converter factory or an explicit helper that turns a
   documented preset repertoire into `createConverter({ repertoire })`.

The second change should initially cover only presets with an exact boundary.
ALA-LC should remain unrestricted until its additional-letter inventory is
resolved. ISO 843 requires an explicit product decision for characters that
are in its source repertoire but lack a prescribed Type 1 conversion.
