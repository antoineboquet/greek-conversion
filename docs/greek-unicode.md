# Greek accentuation and Unicode output

Greek accentuation and Unicode representation are independent stages. The
accentuation system changes the canonical document; Unicode options select how
the resulting Greek text is encoded.

## Accentuation systems

Greek output is polytonic by default. Request the mechanical monotonic profile
with `orthography.accentuation`:

```ts
convert("Ἄνθρωπὸς ᾆ ῑ", "greek", "greek", {
  orthography: { accentuation: "monotonic" },
}); // Άνθρωπός ά ι
```

The monotonic transform:

- preserves diaeresis;
- maps acute, grave, and circumflex to acute;
- removes smooth and rough breathings, coronis, iota subscript, macron, and
  breve;
- does not apply lexical rules such as suppressing stress on particular
  monosyllables.

It is applied only when the target format is Greek. Beta Code and
transliteration retain the source document's polytonic distinctions. The
transform is intentionally lossy and cannot reconstruct the source
accentuation.

## Composed and decomposed output

Greek output is composed by default. Set `unicode.composition` to
`"decomposed"` to emit canonical base letters and combining marks:

```ts
convert("ἄ", "greek", "greek", {
  unicode: { composition: "decomposed" },
}); // U+03B1 U+0313 U+0301
```

`"composed"` describes the intended structure, not a guarantee that the final
string is NFC. Oxia and explicitly requested Greek punctuation have canonical
singleton decompositions and are therefore not stable under NFC.

## Tonos and oxia

`unicode.acute` accepts `"system"`, `"tonos"`, and `"oxia"`. The default
`"system"` policy selects oxia for polytonic output and tonos for monotonic
output:

```ts
convert("ά", "greek", "greek");
// ά — U+1F71 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA

convert("ά", "greek", "greek", {
  orthography: { accentuation: "monotonic" },
});
// ά — U+03AC GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS
```

An explicit value overrides the system preference. It applies only where
Unicode provides alternative composed scalars. Polytonic combinations such as
`ἄ` have no corresponding precomposed “with tonos” character and remain
unchanged. In decomposed output both preferences converge to U+0301 COMBINING
ACUTE ACCENT.

## Greek punctuation scalars

Unicode normalization maps U+037E GREEK QUESTION MARK to U+003B SEMICOLON and
U+0387 GREEK ANO TELEIA to U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT. The canonical forms remain the
default. Exact Greek scalars can be requested after composition:

```ts
formatGreekUnicode("ά;·", {
  acute: "oxia",
  questionMark: "greek",
  anoTeleia: "greek",
}); // ά;·
```

The alternatives are `"semicolon"` and `"middle-dot"`; `"canonical"` is the
default for both punctuation policies.

`formatGreekUnicode()` parses its input as Greek and delegates to the same
encoder as `convert()`. It therefore applies semantic Greek punctuation rules
instead of blind character replacement.

## Code-point inspection

`toUnicodeCodePoints()` reports Unicode scalar values without modifying or
normalizing its input:

```ts
toUnicodeCodePoints("ά;😀");
// ["U+1F71", "U+037E", "U+1F600"]
```

Supplementary characters are returned as one code point, not as two UTF-16
code units.
