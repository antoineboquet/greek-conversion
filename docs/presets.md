# Conversion presets

A preset is a named, coherent set of ordinary `ConversionOptions`. Presets do
not introduce a separate conversion path: they are resolved before parsing and
encoding, and `convertDetailed()` observes the same information loss as if the
resolved options had been supplied individually.

```ts
convert(input, from, to, { preset: "ala-lc-modern" });
```

Custom options can refine or override a preset. Resolution is recursive for
the `orthography`, `diacritics`, and `unicode` groups:

```ts
convert(input, from, to, {
  preset: "ala-lc-modern",
  diacritics: { accents: "preserve" },
  orthography: { letterCase: "uppercase" },
});
```

The precedence is always:

```text
engine defaults < preset < custom options
```

An option only acts in the phases and output formats where it normally applies.
For example, ALA-LC letter spellings affect transliteration, while its numeral
policy can affect every output. This direction-dependent behavior is identical
to activating the same options manually.

Coverage labels describe the relationship between the implementation and its
references: `complete` implements every in-scope rule expressible by the
engine, `partial` implements a documented subset, `adapted` intentionally
defines a library profile from the reference, and `planned` identifies a
profile whose implementation is not complete. None of these labels is an
independent certification of conformity. In particular, accepting characters
beyond a reference's repertoire does not make an otherwise complete preset
partial.

`outOfScopeBehavior` states what happens to recognized content beyond the
cited repertoire. `engine-default` applies the ordinary conversion rules and
therefore does not enforce the reference as a strict validator; `preserve` and
`reject` describe profiles that respectively retain or refuse such content.

## Available presets

The following reference is generated from the same typed registry as the
runtime configurations. Run `deno task docs:presets` after changing preset
metadata or options.

### `perseus` — Perseus Beta Code — Core subset

- **Authority:** Perseus Digital Library
- **Scope:** Polytonic Greek; Perseus and Morpheus interchange

- **Out-of-scope behavior:** `engine-default`

Lowercase-ASCII subset of TLG Beta Code used by the Perseus Digital Library project.

**References:**

## Inspection

Descriptive metadata, sparse preset definitions, immutable defaults, and fully
resolved option objects are public:

```ts
listPresetMetadata();
getPresetMetadata("ala-lc-modern");

DEFAULT_CONVERSION_OPTIONS;
getPresetOptions("ala-lc-modern");
resolveConversionOptions({
  preset: "ala-lc-modern",
  orthography: { beta: "b" },
});
```

`getPresetMetadata()` returns one preset's scope, references, coverage, and
known limitations. `listPresetMetadata()` returns the complete registry in
stable order. `getPresetOptions()` returns only fields contributed by the
selected preset. `resolveConversionOptions()` returns a complete
`ResolvedConversionOptions`, after applying engine defaults, the preset, and
custom overrides. Metadata and option helpers return detached objects; mutating
one cannot modify the immutable defaults or the preset registry.

## Scope limits

Presets never infer a missing rough breathing and do not perform transformations
that intrinsically require lexical or morphological knowledge. Consequently,
ALA-LC output can only render `h` when the source document actually carries a
rough breathing. This is a deliberate scope boundary, not an implicit fallback.

The ALA-LC policy omits diaeresis visually. Under contextual `y/u`, the parser
nevertheless preserves its deterministic provenance: `y` is interpreted as a
separated upsilon where `u` would form a diphthong. This keeps preset output
idempotent without lexical inference.
